                    An Apple store in New York. The company’s quarterly results exceeded Wall Street
                    estimates, but its projections were cautious.

                <p>
                    Despite strong sales of the new iPhone models, Apple’s forecast for the holi&shy;day
                    sea&shy;son — tra&shy;ditionally its strongest quar&shy;ter — was cautious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apple on Tuesday turned in an&shy;oth&shy;er quar&shy;ter of enviable rev&shy;enue
                    and prof&shy;it growth, fu&shy;eled by sales of the iPhone. But the results raised a
                    perenni&shy;al question for the world’s most val&shy;uable com&shy;pa&shy;ny:
                    <span class="special-text">How can it keep its growth streak alive?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over all, Apple posted a prof&shy;it of <span class="special-text">$11.1</span> billion
                    for its fiscal fourth quar&shy;ter, up 31 per&shy;cent from a year ago. Rev&shy;enue
                    was $51.5 billion, up 22 per&shy;cent from last year. The results exceeded Wall Street
                    es&shy;ti&shy;mates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apple projected rev&shy;enue of $75.5 billion to $77.5 billion for the end-of-year
                    quar&shy;ter. While the sheer numbers are huge, the low end of the forecast fell
                    be&shy;low Wall Street es&shy;ti&shy;mates and would amount to ane&shy;mic growth of
                    less than 4 per&shy;cent from a year ago. The last time Apple’s quar&shy;terly sales
                    fell be&shy;low 4 per&shy;cent was in mid-2013.

                <h2>Dismal Twitter Forecast and Flat User Growth Send Its Stock Lower</h2>
                <p>
                    The social me&shy;dia compa&shy;ny, now led by Jack Dorsey, a co-founder, has struggled
                    to make its ser&shy;vice appealing to those who are not devo&shy;ted users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and newly returned chief executive of
                    Twitter, seems to be quite adept at scaring investors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new projections, de&shy;liv&shy;ered as the compa&shy;ny exceeded
                    an&shy;a&shy;lysts’ ex&shy;pec&shy;tations for its third-quar&shy;ter results,
                    pro&shy;vided fresh ev&shy;idence that Twitter is 
                    <span class="special-text">failing</span> to win over adver&shy;tis&shy;ers, the source 
                    of most of its rev&shy;enue, as it confronts stiff&shy;ening com&shy;pe&shy;tition from
                    Face&shy;book, Insta&shy;gram and Google.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twitter’s intensi&shy;fied efforts to lure more newcom&shy;ers to the ser&shy;vice are
                    also not yet de&shy;liv&shy;ering results. The compa&shy;ny said it had
                    <span class="special-text">320 million users</span> in the third quar&shy;ter, up
                    slightly from 316 million in the sec&shy;ond quar&shy;ter. Excluding people who
                    subscribe to the ser&shy;vice via text message, a group that Wall Street consid&shy;ers
                    less val&shy;uable, the compa&shy;ny had 307 million users, roughly flat with the
                    pre&shy;vi&shy;ous quar&shy;ter.
