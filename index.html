                    An Apple store in New York. The company’s quarterly results exceeded Wall Street
                    estimates, but its projections were cautious.

                    Despite strong sales of the new iPhone models, Apple’s forecast for the holi&shy;day
                    sea&shy;son — tra&shy;ditionally its strongest quar&shy;ter — was cautious.

                    Apple on Tuesday turned in an&shy;oth&shy;er quar&shy;ter of enviable rev&shy;enue
                    and prof&shy;it growth, fu&shy;eled by sales of the iPhone. But the results raised a
                    perenni&shy;al question for the world’s most val&shy;uable com&shy;pa&shy;ny:
                    <span class="specialText">How can it keep its growth streak alive?</span>

                <h2>Dismal Twitter Forecast and Flat User Growth Send Its Stock Lower</h2>
                <p>
                    The social me&shy;dia compa&shy;ny, now led by Jack Dorsey, a co-founder, has struggled
                    to make its ser&shy;vice appealing to those who are not devo&shy;ted users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SAN FRANCISCO — Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and newly returned chief executive of
                    Twitter, seems to be quite adept at scaring investors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new projections, de&shy;liv&shy;ered as the compa&shy;ny exceeded
                    an&shy;a&shy;lysts’ ex&shy;pec&shy;tations for its third-quar&shy;ter results,
                    pro&shy;vided fresh ev&shy;idence that Twitter is failing to win over
                    adver&shy;tis&shy;ers, the source of most of its rev&shy;enue, as it confronts
                    stiff&shy;ening com&shy;pe&shy;tition from Face&shy;book, Insta&shy;gram and Google.
